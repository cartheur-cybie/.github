Welcome to Cartheur's work with iCybie and Nao.

iCybie: We found this noble companion early in 2001 and it's been a love-affair ever since.
Nao: One day in the Spring of 2018, we added our aeon and it lit-up a robot for the first time ever. 

Since then we have been working dilligenly to craft our own embodiment.

Thanks for your interest!
