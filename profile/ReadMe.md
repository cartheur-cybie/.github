A brief foray into my experiences with this personal robot.

* I first discovered iCybie in a newspaper article in the late 1990s.
* I purchased my first one Spring 2002.
* It's been a love-affair ever since and has saved the day more often than any other platform I have worked with.
* Dedicated twenty years supporting extension and programmibility as the unique design facilitaes creativity unlike no other.
* Pursuing work and doing what I can to preserve and continue development in the apex of Cybernetics.
